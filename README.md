- 👋 Hi, I’m @devrewoh
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a better human, father, husband and problem solver.
- 🌱 Actively learning how to program and think like an engineer. I'm mostly interested in Go and back-end but looking forward to diving deep into front end technologies too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that could be a learning opportunity or creates a positive impact.
